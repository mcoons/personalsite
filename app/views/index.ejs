                        <p>I'm a Hoosier. Born and bred in Indiana where I lived the majority of my life.  I attended Indiana University where I got my degree in Computer Science.</p>
                        <p>Southern Indiana boasts some beautiful fall colors.  People come from miles around to visit Brown County when the leaves are changing.</p>
                        <p>I've recently relocated to the beautiful state of Colorado.  I moved here to continue my education and break into the field of Web Development.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not geeking out with computers, I like to fill me free time with outdoor activities.</p>
                        <p>Now that I live in Colorado, I can't help but be drawn to the mountains.  I enjoy exploring the Rockies and discovering the out of the way streams and rivers.  In the near future, I want to gear up for back country hiking and camping.</p>
                        <p>I became interested in photography many years ago and Colorado is a photographer's dream. I am working on visiting and photographing as many parks and open spaces as I can.</p>
